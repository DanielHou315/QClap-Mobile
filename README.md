**March 2022 Update: iPad Screen is still too reflective and not bright enough.**
**Use a regular slate and Azure video indexer instead :)**


This is a lightweight Clapperboard app for iPadOS with dynamic QR Code built in to encode all scene information. 

This project includes the iPadOS client and a desktop client to scan QR codes in video footages and rename/categorize based on user defined rules. The desktop client app is in closed development and will come soon 

The project is currently not funded to be potentialy released on the App Store.
